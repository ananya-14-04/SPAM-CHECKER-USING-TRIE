# SPAM-CHECKER-USING-TRIE
Spam emails are one of the most irritating things, and it eats up a lot of space, so to deal with that, 
we have a spam checker.
Spam checker checks for some specific words in a file, which is considered spam when exceeding a 
certain number of repetitions in a file
The project checks for spam mails. There is a file where you can add the words/sentences which are 
or can be categorized as spam, the code basically searches for these spam words in the content sent 
for checking, if the content contains those words, it is considered to be a spam, else given a clean 
chit
